No upload completed signal was sent. Thanks to [gloriouslyawkwardlife](https://github.com/gloriouslyawkwardlife) for catching this!

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-19

### Added
- Optional file size enforcement for uploads (enabled by default, max 5MB).
- New `enforce_max_size` parameter for `notion_upload`, `internal_upload`, and `external_upload`.

- Remote file size is checked via `Content-Length` header before download when available.

### Changed
- External uploads now perform a HEAD request before download (if size check is enabled).
